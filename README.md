# TropFishR.select
Selectivity explorations of single-species fish stock assessments in a data-poor context.

# Context
Building upon the R package [TropFishR](https://github.com/tokami/TropFishR), this project explores the impact of gear selectivities on fisheries analysis and fish stock assessments in a data-poor context. Some functions of this package are adapted from the repository [fishdynr](https://github.com/marchtaylor/fishdynr) by marchtaylor.
